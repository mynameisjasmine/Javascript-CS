// Understand the Problem

// Questions to ask yourself when trying to understand a problem

/* 
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the input? (ie do I have enough information to solve the problem)
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?
